The Internet of Things Trebuchet
================

The backend for a trebuchet hooked up to a Raspberry Pi that also plays Smashmouth.  

## Why does it exist?

We are not entirely sure. We thought that this was a good idea at the time. And, for the most part, it probably is. We envisioned shooting various objects at certain targets and we succeeded, though we define success as a very loose term. Our ammunition was primarily candy, though we also have launched other objects such as nuts and bolts, eating utensils, and various unnamed metallic objects. 

## Usage & Installation

With how complex and undescribably difficult this piece of art is, we have done our utmost best to trivialize the enigma that is the installation. We have facilitated this process tremendously by using black magic to compile our code. 

(Run 'make' inside the folder through the terminal, or use your preferred C compiler.)

If you run into a segfault, then that would be an unfortunate series of events that is undeniably irreparable. Sorry.
